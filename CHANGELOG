- (TZ) Added PhTreeRevisited.pdf


2015-10-11
==========
- (TZ) Fixed possible NPE (in Critbit64COW) when using trees with k>6
- (TZ) Fixed memory waste in NodeEntries

2015-08-31
==========
- (TZ) Proper NoGC iterator for avoiding any object creation (+bug fix)
- (TZ) Changed iterator recursion to loops
- (TZ) Removed some old iterators and NV usage

2015-08-03
==========
- (TZ) PhQuery interface added. This allows resetting & reusing of query iterators.

2015-07-30
==========
- (TZ) Smaller NodeEntries + Avoid NodeEntry creation in some situations
- (TZ) Added experimental iterator that does not create new long[]...

2015-07-29
==========
- Added clear() method
- Fixed bug that prevented internal iterators from being reused (-> performance)
- Fixed another bug that caused queryAll to skip some matching keys.

==========
- API change! Refactored the API for simplification and removal of old non-value API.
  
  
2015-03-03
==========
- Significantly reduced object creation during insert/update/delete/query. This should reduce
  GC problems.
- New queryAll() function that returns a list of results instead of an iterator. This should
  be faster especially for small expected result sets.
